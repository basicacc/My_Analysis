I started analyzing the malware for a day, mostly using dynamic analyse tools. Normally the file that is downloaded is around 100kb but after unpacking itself, it is around 30kb. We need to put hardware breakpoint at `0x401ae0` to be able to dynamically debug program. Also I dumped process to ghidra, so I can do static analysis too. If you check memory in x32dbg or SystemInformer, everything can be Read/Written/Executed. That's why it can rewrite itself.
