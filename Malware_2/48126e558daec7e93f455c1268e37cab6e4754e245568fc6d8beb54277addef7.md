As I was looking out for new malwares appearing online, i saw another PE32 executable malware and just decided to check it out, this malware was actually pretty simple.
The purpose of the malware is use as much resource (RAM, CPU) as possible by copying itself and creating new process of itself. But honestly it was good malware to help me improve myself.

Simple demonstration of malware's capability:
