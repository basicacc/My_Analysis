File is probably dropper, trying to install dangerous malware from spinistry.com:
## Connections

## DNS

## URL

*   HTTP Headers
    * Method: `GET`
    * URI: `/wp-share/7eve.exe`
    * Version: `HTTP/1.1`
    * Accept: `text/*, application/*`
    * User-Agent: `Updates downloader`
    * Host: `spinistry.com`
    * Cache-Control: `no-cache`
    * Transport Layer Protocol: `TCP`
    * Destination IP: `192.0.2.123`
    * Destination port: `443`
    * SSL encrypted: `Yes`
    * Network mode: `singlehost`


The malware has actually a few more steps, accessing registry keys, creating a new file and doing all these in a hidden way. File is UPX compressed so I couldn't work on it so much. I will continue to debug it.

I will attach a file that shows results of rework.exe which is created in directory: C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Temp\rework.exe by the fa132c7ca003a5fd97d96c3b656212802cf70f1735283b05144bdcae03e24894.exe (which is the first stage of malware)

I will upload way more information regarding to this, but for now that's all.





NOTE: I am new to Malware Analysis so I try to practice a lot to learn, if I make mistakes I would appreciate the help.
